<h3 id="LLtitle"> Life Long Learning:</h3>

<h4 id="LLItagline"> <i>Learning and growing helps everyone at every stage of life, and for seniors, the benefits are endless.</i></h4>

<p>Ebenezer's Life Long Learning Initiative is a collection of coordinated arts and education programs designed to foster growth and creativity for seniors. Life-long learning is the process of keeping your mind, body and spirit engaged -at any age - by actively pursuing knowledge and experience.

</p>

<p>Research has shown that with opportunities for self expression and discovery, seniors experience vibrant living, artistic growth as well as improved mental and physical health. Life Long Learning helps our residents stay connected to their world - both locally and beyond.

<p>Last month our program participants took an outing to the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum! It was a beautiful day to take a look at the huge variety of plants this garden has to offer. Each senior got to enjoy some fresh air and beautiful scenery. Special thanks to our volunteers who assisted any residents with chairs and other mobility issues. </p>
